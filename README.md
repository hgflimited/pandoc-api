# Pandoc API
**A Haskell web API providing Pandoc as a web service.**

In it's current state, the app allows for a *markdown file* to be converted into either a *pdf* or *docx* file via Pandoc. 

This doesn't provide a wrapper around the Pandoc command line program, but instead, utilises the internal Pandoc functionality available in Haskell.
